# NestJs CI/CD Project 


## Description

This project is a CI/CD pipeline implementation for a NestJS application using GitHub Actions. 

The pipeline is designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring that changes are thoroughly tested and safely deployed to production. With this pipeline in place, the development team can focus on writing code, while the pipeline handles the rest, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
